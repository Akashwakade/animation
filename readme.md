Here’s a professional and beginner-friendly `README.md` for your animation project. It explains each part of your HTML code with step-by-step guidance:

# 🌀 Simple HTML Animation with Background and Marquee

This project demonstrates a **basic HTML animation** using background images and the `<marquee>` tag to move images across the screen. It uses simple HTML and CSS, and can be used as a beginner project for learning visual effects in webpages.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

* **HTML** for structuring the page
* **CSS** for styling background
* `<marquee>` for image animation (Note: Deprecated in HTML5, but used here for learning purposes)

---

## 📜 Step-by-Step Explanation

### 1. **HTML Setup**

```html
<html>
<head><title>animation</title>
```

* Creates the basic structure and sets the title of the webpage to **"animation"**.

---

### 2. **Background Styling Using CSS**

```html
<style>
body {
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-size: 100% 100%;
  background-attachment: fixed;
}
</style>
```

* Ensures the background:

  * Does **not repeat** (`no-repeat`)
  * **Covers the full screen** (`100% 100%`)
  * **Stays fixed** during scroll (`background-attachment: fixed`)

---

### 3. **Setting the Background Image**

```html
<body background="animation/bg.jpg">
```

* Adds a background image (`bg.jpg`) from the `animation/` folder to the entire page.

---

### 4. **Vertical Spacing Using `<br>` Tags**

```html
<br><br> ... repeated
```

* Adds vertical space above the animation.
* (⚠️ Not best practice — better to use CSS margin/padding, but this is acceptable for beginners.)

---

### 5. **Animating Images with `<marquee>`**

```html
<marquee direction="right" scrollamount="30">
  <img src="animation/a.gif" width="22%" /> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
  <img src="animation/b.gif" width="11%" /> &emsp;
  <img src="animation/c.gif" width="4%" />
</marquee>
```

* Moves the images from **left to right** using `<marquee>`.
* `scrollamount="30"` controls speed (higher value = faster).
* Images:

  * `a.gif`: Large animated image
  * `b.gif`: Medium
  * `c.gif`: Small
* `&emsp;` adds horizontal space between images.

---

## ⚠️ Notes

* `<marquee>` is **deprecated** in HTML5. For modern animation, use **CSS animations** or **JavaScript**.
* Use of multiple `<br>` tags is discouraged in modern HTML. Use CSS `margin` or `padding` instead.

---

## ✅ How to Run

1. Create a folder called `animation-project`.
2. Place your `index.html` file inside it.
3. Create a subfolder `animation/` and place `bg.jpg`, `a.gif`, `b.gif`, and `c.gif` inside it.
4. Open `index.html` in your browser.

---

## 🖼️ Preview

You’ll see animated GIFs moving from left to right over a full-screen background image.
